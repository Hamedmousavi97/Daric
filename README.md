Daric is an iOS based application developed using Swift.

Daric, as defined by dictionary.com, refers to an ancient gold coin from the Persian Empire. The platform's
goal is to offer an opportunity for individuals to earn rewards while engaging in activities such as teaching,
learning, and working out. Daric allows users to create channels, upload videos, share resources, and
challenge other users to utilise their content. Access to all channels is available to users who have joined and
paid the appropriate entrance fee, enabling them to earn rewards upon completion. This system fosters user
engagement by providing a means for interaction, challenges, and motivation among participants.
